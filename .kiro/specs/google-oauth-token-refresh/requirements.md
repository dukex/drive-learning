# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements automatic Google OAuth token refresh management for maintaining persistent access to Google Drive APIs. The system will detect expired access tokens, automatically refresh them using stored refresh tokens, and handle various token-related error scenarios to ensure uninterrupted access to Google Drive content.

## Glossary

- **Token_Refresh_System**: The automated system that manages OAuth token lifecycle and refresh operations
- **Access_Token**: Short-lived OAuth token (typically 1 hour) used for Google API authentication
- **Refresh_Token**: Long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens without user re-authentication
- **Token_Expiry_Detection**: The mechanism that identifies when access tokens have expired or are about to expire
- **Google_OAuth_Service**: Google's OAuth 2.0 service that handles token refresh operations
- **BetterAuth_Database**: The SQLite database where OAuth tokens are stored by the BetterAuth library
- **API_Request_Interceptor**: Component that intercepts API requests to handle token refresh before retrying failed requests

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically refresh my Google access token when it expires, so that I can continue accessing Google Drive content without re-authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Access_Token expires, THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL automatically obtain a new Access_Token using the stored Refresh_Token
2. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL update the BetterAuth_Database with the new Access_Token
3. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL retry the original API request with the new Access_Token
4. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL complete token refresh operations within 5 seconds
5. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL maintain user session continuity during token refresh

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to detect when my access token is expired before making API calls, so that I experience minimal delays from failed requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Token_Expiry_Detection SHALL identify expired Access_Tokens before Google Drive API calls
2. WHEN an Access_Token is expired or expires within 5 minutes, THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL proactively refresh the token
3. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL cache token expiry information to avoid repeated database queries
4. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL validate Access_Token format and structure before API calls
5. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL handle timezone differences in token expiry calculations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle API authentication errors gracefully, so that temporary token issues don't break my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Drive API returns a 401 authentication error, THE API_Request_Interceptor SHALL attempt token refresh
2. THE API_Request_Interceptor SHALL retry the original request exactly once after successful token refresh
3. IF token refresh fails, THEN THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL redirect the user to re-authenticate
4. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL log token refresh attempts and failures for debugging
5. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL provide clear error messages when refresh operations fail

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle refresh token expiry appropriately, so that I'm prompted to re-authenticate when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Refresh_Token is expired or invalid, THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL detect this condition
2. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL clear invalid tokens from the BetterAuth_Database
3. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL redirect users to the Google OAuth flow for re-authentication
4. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL preserve the user's intended destination for post-authentication redirect
5. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL display appropriate messaging about the need for re-authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the token refresh system to integrate seamlessly with the existing Google Drive service, so that no changes are required to existing API call code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL integrate with the existing GoogleDriveService class transparently
2. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL maintain the same API interface for getUserSession function
3. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL handle token refresh without requiring changes to existing course and lesson components
4. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL provide backward compatibility with current authentication flows
5. THE Token_Refresh_System SHALL implement proper error boundaries to prevent system crashes during token operations
