# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Google OAuth authentication for a Next.js application, enabling users to sign in with their Google accounts. The system will provide a welcome page for unauthenticated users and a protected authenticated page for signed-in users. This authentication foundation will later support Google Drive API integration.

## Glossary

- **Authentication_System**: The Google OAuth-based login system that manages user authentication state
- **Welcome_Page**: The public landing page displayed to unauthenticated users
- **Authenticated_Page**: The protected page accessible only to users who have successfully signed in with Google
- **Google_OAuth**: Google's OAuth 2.0 authentication service for secure user login
- **BetterAuth_Library**: A Next.js authentication library that handles OAuth flows and session management
- **User_Session**: The authenticated state maintained for a signed-in user

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see a welcome page when I'm not authenticated, so that I understand the application and can choose to sign in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL display the Welcome_Page when no valid User_Session exists
2. THE Welcome_Page SHALL provide a clear sign-in option using Google_OAuth
3. THE Welcome_Page SHALL display appropriate messaging about the application's purpose
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL redirect unauthenticated users to the Welcome_Page when they attempt to access protected content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to sign in with my Google account, so that I can access the authenticated features of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the Google sign-in button, THE Authentication_System SHALL initiate the Google_OAuth flow
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL redirect users to Google's authentication service
3. WHEN Google_OAuth returns a successful authentication, THE Authentication_System SHALL create a valid User_Session
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL redirect successfully authenticated users to the Authenticated_Page
5. IF Google_OAuth returns an error, THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL display an appropriate error message on the Welcome_Page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to access a protected page, so that I can use the application's authenticated features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL display the Authenticated_Page only when a valid User_Session exists
2. THE Authenticated_Page SHALL display the user's Google profile information
3. THE Authenticated_Page SHALL provide a sign-out option
4. WHEN an authenticated user navigates to the root path, THE Authentication_System SHALL display the Authenticated_Page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to sign out of the application, so that I can end my session securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the sign-out button, THE Authentication_System SHALL terminate the User_Session
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL redirect signed-out users to the Welcome_Page
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL clear all authentication tokens and session data
4. AFTER sign-out, THE Authentication_System SHALL prevent access to the Authenticated_Page until re-authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to use a reliable Next.js library, so that the implementation follows security best practices and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL use BetterAuth_Library for OAuth implementation
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL configure Google_OAuth with proper client credentials
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL handle session management securely
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL provide proper error handling for authentication failures
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL maintain authentication state across page refreshes
