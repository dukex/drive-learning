# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A refactoring project to rename all "chapter" terminology to "lesson" throughout the Google Drive courses system. This change improves the clarity and educational context of the course structure, making it more intuitive for students to understand that courses contain lessons rather than chapters.

## Glossary

- **Course_Management_System**: The existing web application that displays and manages Google Drive courses
- **Chapter**: The current terminology for subdirectories within courses (to be renamed)
- **Lesson**: The new terminology for subdirectories within courses (replacing chapter)
- **Chapter_File**: Current terminology for files within chapters (to be renamed)
- **Lesson_File**: New terminology for files within lessons (replacing chapter file)
- **Refactoring_Process**: The systematic process of updating code, file names, and documentation

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Course_Management_System SHALL rename all directories containing "chapter" to use "lesson"
2. THE Course_Management_System SHALL rename all files containing "chapter" to use "lesson"
3. THE Course_Management_System SHALL update all import statements to reference the new file names
4. THE Course_Management_System SHALL update all dynamic route folders from [chapterId] to [lessonId]
5. THE Course_Management_System SHALL maintain all existing functionality during the renaming process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI to display "lessons" instead of "chapters", so that the interface uses clear educational terminology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. THE Course_Management_System SHALL update all database models and interfaces to use Lesson terminology
3. THE Course_Management_System SHALL update all API response structures to use lesson field names
4. THE Course_Management_System SHALL update all service layer methods to use lesson terminology
5. THE Course_Management_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility during the transition

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all documentation and comments, so that the codebase documentation reflects the new terminology.
